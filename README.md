# ConstructorWordGuess "Guess the Weapon"

About this project:
This project is a command line version of the Hangman game. I created a command line version using Javascript constructor functions to create letter and word objects, inquirer npm package to prompt users to guess a letter, and Node.js to run the Javascript code from the command line.
